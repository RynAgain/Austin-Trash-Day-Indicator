Starting development.  Focusing on the webscraping aspect first.

Using Selenium was a more complex than it was worth for this particular task.  Thankfully the youtube algo provided me the perfect video that brought me to a new solution to my problem.  https://youtu.be/DqtlR0y0suo

With the variables easy to obtain, i can now work on the raspberry pi portion of the project!

### 10/6/22
Made a new main file, removing the old one and putting into a a legacy folder.  I want to keep the code for future reference. 

I think i finished the code?  I gotta build the electronics and test it... I'll add photos of all that.
